                <div class="chunk-of-text">
                    To kickstart my career in tech, I figured it would be helpful to have a personal website to advertise
                    myself and any projects I may embark on in the future. I do think it's kind of meta to include your own
                    website as a project on the website itself but I'm considering this my first personal project because
                    I coded everything on my own (i.e. surfing through an unquotable amount of Google and Stack Overflow pages.) <br><br>

                    The first version of my site was, well, hilariously ugly to say the least. I was mainly focused on
                    creating and uploading a renderable (is that a word?) version, so I goofed around with the colors and sizes
                    to gain some understanding of how front-end development worked. I created three different pages - Home, About,
                    and Contact - to divide up the site.
                </div>

                <div id="projects-row">
                    <div class="projects-images">
                        <img src="updateImgs/4-11-19-Home.png" alt="first Home">
                    </div>

                    <div class="projects-images">
                        <img src="updateImgs/4-11-19-Contact.png" alt="first Contact">
                    </div>

                    <div class="projects-images">
                        <img src="updateImgs/4-11-19-About.png" alt="first About">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="chunk-of-text">
                    In the second version, I shifted my focus to make the page more visually appealing, which mainly involved
                    working with the CSS side of things. I also shifted from a three page approach to one long page because I thought
                    it would be easier for users to navigate my site if there was only one page to stay on. The color scheme was still
                    pretty ugly, but everything was starting to come together!

                    This is currently the third version of my site. I'm pretty pleased with the color and font schemes and the 
                    overall layout of the page, so until I change my mind I'm sticking to this. I think there are some issues
                    with the mobile layout so I need to go back and fix those but I'm not planning on updating this post 
                    for that. Happy browsing!
